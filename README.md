Information needed to Design my website for Sellings Cars Online
ONLINE CAR SALES PLATFORM

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

This project is a web-based car selling platform where users can sign up, log in, and post their cars for sale. Each car listing includes images, descriptions, and details like make, model, year, and price. To ensure listing quality and platform sustainability, users are required to pay a small fee of KES 5 via M-Pesa before each post is published. The platform features secure user authentication, payment integration using Safaricomâ€™s Daraja API, and a relational database to manage users, listings, and payment records.
